Welcome to my personal portfolio website.
This is where I showcase my skills and my learning journey through projects.
I have built my portfolio with HTML, CSS and basic Javascript features which I will be making advanced changes to as I continue learning and growing.
I will also be adding more projects to my portfolio as a testament to my continued growth in learning and practice.

MAIN FEATURES:
 - Responsive design
 - Home Section
 - About Me section
 - Projects section
 - Contact section with a live contact form
