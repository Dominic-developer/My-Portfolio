        <p>Hello. My Name is Dominic Kipsang. I am a self-taught Web Developer.
            I am very passionate about creating and designing clean, modern,
            proffessional websites. Through this I help bussinesses, both start-ups
            and also established ones get a platform to showcase their
            products and services while also standing out online.
        </p>
        <p>I started my journey into Web Developement in January 2025. It has been
            a slow but interesting journey of learning, unlearning and restarting
            over again.
        </p>
        <p>I am really passionate about this journey as I get to witness and enjoy the
            process of making websites not only come to life, but also being a part of 
            making bussinesses and insitutions get an online space to show the world
            what they do and offer to their potential clients.
        </p>
        <p>Over the period of time I have been learing, I am proud that today
            I am gaining profficiency in number of tools that help me make this process 
            a success, which are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>GitHub</li>
            <li>Figma</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Apart from Web Developement, I am also deeply interested in CyberSecurity
            which I do explore in my free time, with a vision to eventually transition to in
            the near furture.
        </p>

            on the projects I have managed to build down below.
